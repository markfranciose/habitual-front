# Habit Builder - Front End
Welcome to the Habit Builder's front end repository.  To get started, your local machine will need to have Node and npm installed. While npm does have the capability to handle module version control, this application is best installed using Facebook's yarn.

In your console, follow these installations steps:

```brew install node```
```brew install yarn```

After these initial installations, clone the repository in your console using git:
```git clone https://github.com/markfranciose/habitual-front```

Then navigate to the root directory
```cd habitual-front```

And follow these installation instructions:
```npm install react-native-cli```
```yarn install```

To boot up, please be sure that Xcode on your Mac has been opened at least once with a new default project of any kind.  If your computer has been recently restored via an installation image, **you must follow this step to have the program work correctly on your machine**.
