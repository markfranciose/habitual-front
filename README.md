# Habit Builder - Front End [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sanjaynelson/habitual.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sanjaynelson/habitual) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native)

## Installation
To get started, your local machine will need to have [Node](http://wikipedia.org) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm) installed. While npm does have the capability to handle module version control, this application is best installed using Facebook's yarn.

If you do not have either node or yarn installed, follow these installations steps:

```brew install node```

```brew install yarn```

If you have either program, please ensure that the latest updates are installed:

```brew upgrade node```

```brew upgrade yarn```

After these initial installations, clone the repository in your console using git:

```git clone https://github.com/markfranciose/habitual-front```

If your computer has been recently restored via an installation image or factory reset, **you must open XCode at least once with a new project of any kind in order to initialize the program**

After XCode intialization, navigate to the root directory:

```cd habitual-front```

Install react native to the file locally:

```npm install react-native-cli```

or globally
```npm install -g react-native-cli```

Install yarn for the best dependency management:
```yarn install```

After everything is installed, run the application by entering the following command:
```react-native run-ios```

The first execution of this function will take approximately 5-6 minutes.  It is important to let the full process take place.  If the emulator pops up, **please do not open the program**.  XCode will automatically open the app when all modules and files have been cached to the emulator.

If there are errors with loading, in the root directory, reload npm by typing the following:

```npm install```


*This application has been developed for Mac and iOS only.  Functionality on Android and Window/Linux-based systems is not guaranteed.*

## History
The Habitual app is the idea of Mark Franciose who remembers telling a fellow colleage that habit change was more or less impossible.  On reflection of that piece of mis-placed advice, a team was assembled under Mark's vision to make habit change not only possible, but enjoyable and easy.  As part of the final project for DevBootcamp whose curriculum was mostly web-application based, the team decided to build this solution on the React-Native framework.  The group had 8 days to learn and build this application having no prior knowledge of mobile application development.  The information in this repository is a reflection of that work.

## Current State
The Habitual application is a mobile solution with an API backend to help users accomplish a longer-term goals through small and steady habit reminders and progress statistics.  A user can add or delete however many habits they wish and is reminded of that habit daily at the time of their choosing upon the creation of the habit.

## Future Features
On reflection of the current state of the application and the completion of the 8 days, the next steps towards this application more market ready include:
- Accessing habits through multiple devices
- Enabling more flexibility with reminders and the displaying of statistics
- A more thorough dive into data visualization through the D3.js and React-ART framework
