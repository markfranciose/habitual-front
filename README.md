# Habit Builder - Front End [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sanjaynelson/habitual.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sanjaynelson/habitual) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native)

Welcome to the Habit Builder's front end repository.

## Installation
To get started, your local machine will need to have [Node](http://wikipedia.org) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) (npm) installed. While npm does have the capability to handle module version control, this application is best installed using Facebook's yarn.

If you do not have either node or yarn installed, follow these installations steps:

```brew install node```

```brew install yarn```

If you have either program, please ensure that the latest updates are installed:

```brew upgrade node```

```brew upgrade yarn```

After these initial installations, clone the repository in your console using git:

```git clone https://github.com/markfranciose/habitual-front```

If your computer has been recently restored via an installation image or factory reset, **you must open XCode at least once with a new project of any kind in order to initialize the program**

After XCode intialization, navigate to the root directory:

```cd habitual-front```

Install react native to the file locally:

```npm install react-native-cli```

or globally
```npm install -g react-native-cli```

Install yarn for the best dependency management:
```yarn install```

After everything is installed, run the application by entering the following command:
```react-native run-ios```

The first execution of this function will take approximately 5-6 minutes.  It is important to let the full process take place.  If the emulator pops up, **please do not open the program**.  XCode will automatically open the app when all modules and files have been cached to the emulator.

If there are errors with loading, in the root directory, reload npm by typing the following:

```npm install```


*This application has been developed for Mac and iOS only.  Functionality on Android and Window/Linux-based systems is not guaranteed.*
